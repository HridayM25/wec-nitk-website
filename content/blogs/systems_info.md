The Systems and Security Special Interest Group (SIG) is a group of students interested in the inner workings of the technology around them. It deals with a broad range of topics, including but not limited to 

- Networking
- Operating Systems
- Distributed Systems
- Security
- Databases
- System Design
- Cloud Native Technologies
- And of course, Linux


We at Systems SIG aim to provide a niche community for exploring all kinds of systems and security-related topics. We conduct regular CTFs (Capture the Flag events) sessions, workshops, and discussions on these topics. We also have a dedicated Discord server where we discuss and share resources on these topics.

We have been part of the larger WebClub community since inception.

## Highlights of Our Activities

### 1. CTF Intro Session

We conducted a CTF (Capture The Flag) introductory session to introduce the participants to cybersecurity and ethical hacking. The session covered the basics of CTFs, the different types of challenges, and the tools required to solve them. We provide all the needed resources and guidance to help the participants get started with CTFs.

### 2. Linux Installation Drive and Workshop

We conducted a Linux workshop to introduce the participants to the Linux operating system. The workshop covered the basics of Linux, including the command line interface, file system, and basic commands. We also discussed the different distributions of Linux and their applications.

NOTE: This event has historically been the starting point of many of our members' journey into the world of Linux and Open Source Software.

### 3. Intro to Kubernetes (K8s)

A workshop on Kubernetes was conducted to introduce the participants to the world of container orchestration. 

It starts with docker and then moves on to Kubernetes. The workshop covers the basics of Kubernetes, including the architecture, components, and how to deploy applications on a Kubernetes cluster. The participants also get hands-on experience with Kubernetes by deploying a sample application on a local cluster.


During the whole journey, various small tasks are given to the participants to ensure that they are following along and understanding the concepts. And obviously, the SIG members are always there to help out with any queries.

We conducted a Capture The Flag (CTF) event where participants had to solve a series of challenges to find the hidden flag. The event was open to all students and was conducted online. The participants had to solve challenges related to cryptography, steganography, web exploitation, and reverse engineering.

All the challenges are designed by the SIG members which makes it a great learning experience for them as well.

### 5. Lightning Talks

We conduct a series called the "Lightning Talks" where members present on a topic of their choice for 5-10 minutes. This is a great way for members to share their knowledge and learn from each other.

The most recent one had the following topics

- Merkel Patricia Tree and Ethereum
- How to run a C program?
- Active Directory (how to exploit it)
- Helm

### 6. Security Discussions

These are some of the most interesting activities that we conduct. We carry out regular discussions on various recent security incidents and vulnerabilities, and how to prevent them. This is a great way to stay updated with the latest security trends and learn how to secure your systems.

Quite often these discussions are accompanied by a hands-on session where we try to exploit the vulnerabilities in our own systems in a sandboxed environment.

### Getting involved

Getting into the Systems SIG depends mostly on your passion and interests. Still, we would like to give you some pointers:

- You should have a passion for learning new things and a generally curious mind for taking systems apart.
- Familiarise yourself with basic tools - command line, git/github, etc.
- Participate in CTFs, (this will boost your chances of getting in)
- Pick some language and get proficient with it
