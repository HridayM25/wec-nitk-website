## Who We Are
We are the Intelligence Special Interest Group of Web Enthusiasts' Club, where primary interest of everyone is Artificial Intelligence and its associated domains.

## What We Do
We explore the domains of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), focusing on both research and applications. We research topics in ML theory, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Data Science, etc. and their applications in simulated and real worlds. We are also interested in competitive ML, primarily participating in Kaggle contests and applying ML techniques for software products

## Highlights of Events at Intel SIG

### 1. ML League
It is a series of events targeting the first-years and second-years to kickstart their journey towards Machine Learning. We conduct various sessions covering all the basics of AI ML to help them learn better. For academic year 2024-25, it has been started already and going on in virtual mode during the summer holidays

### 2. Kaggle Community
Starting this year, we are creating a community to encourage particiaption in Kaggle competitions and hold discussions about all things related to Kaggle -be it competitions, code discussions, models, datasets, knowledge sharing and much more!

---
### 3. Papers We Love !
One of the major perks of being part of Intel SIG, these special series of talks are mainly internal to the sig members. Here, we share research papers with our peers, read them along, and hold a discussion to brainstorm over it more.

---
### 4. Knowledge Sharing Programs
Another set of talks, focussing on niche areas of applications of AI, to explore and discuss newer ways of applying machine brain and solving human problems with AI.
